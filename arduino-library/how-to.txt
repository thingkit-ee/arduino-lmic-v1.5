Copy this folder to Arduino libraries folder as is.
For example on Mac OS I have Documents/Arduino/libraries/lmic/
Reference:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
You can use the script create-library.sh in this folder to generate the symlinks.
How to compile the project:
Simply open the sketch file from the examples directory (of this repo), that is already tuned to using the library from the Arduino's library directory.
